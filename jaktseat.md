##Computer Skills
1. I have only programmed in C++ but I am learning C for CS360
2. I also have a little experience with the [GODOT game engine](https://godotengine.org/).
3. I have also used Git with Bitbucket before

##Background
I am a junior computer science student here at UTK who transferred here last fall from UT Martin.
I transferred because I didn't like how small Martin was and wanted to be at a larger university with more oppurtunity.
I have an interest in game design and I am also pursuing a graphic design minor.
