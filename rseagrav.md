Major: Computer Science

Background: I have always been interested in messing with computers and computer hardware since I was a child, this has remained unchanged since 1st grade (to my knowledge, may be earlier). I pride myself on being a menace to TA's, I will do every assignment correctly and submitted on time, but will always get TA comments such as "Why would you solve it that way?" and "How does this run fast?"

Interests: I am in a campus ministry called Chi Alpha, as well as the Christian apologetics organization on campus called [Ratio Christi](https://ratiochristi.org/chapter/university-of-tennessee/). I am very interested in the world of missions and plan on specializing in cybersecurity and business infrastructure to help missionaries in the field be safe. I also like videogames, clocking over 5,000 hours in [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com).

Computer languages, tools, and frameworks I am familiar with:
* C/C++
* Splunk (log agregation tool)
* Checkmk
* Fortress N-Able
* Freshworks Freshservice (digital asset management)
* Jira
