### My Background and Interests

Background: I'm from Clarksville, TN and it's been that way for a long time. I'm a senior computer engineering, but most of my "career" has been in the field of computer science. I've had two internships, one at ORNL and one at a company called Asurion. I enjoy group work, but my schedule is a little crazy, so it's not uncommon to see me work on a project at 4 in the morning and be asleep in the afternoon. 

Interests: Computers. Other than that I think cloud services are cool. Game development is pretty cool too, wouldn't wanna work professionally in the field though. I like front-end design a lil too.
