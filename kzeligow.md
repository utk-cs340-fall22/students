A Polish kid figuring out what he is doing in Knoxville. I love data oriented and functional programming, but won't hate on some mutable stuff (only if it is for the optimization sake). I have been coding for the past 8 years, altought my biggest love so far was TypeScript.
I love music, I play piano, cajon, and currently playing with bass guitar. I also am a board games enthustiast (7 wonders is the GOAT). I also consider myself an optimazation freak, so computer games like Factorio are my definition of fun.
