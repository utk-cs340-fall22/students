# Time's up

## Summary
The project is to make an app for a popular party game. It would allow the user to enter a link and create a game, that others would be able to join.

## Problem
The game is a lot of fun, but it is a pain to setup. Not always do you have enough paper and pencils on the spot. The game would allow to start game with either the words already in the database, or allow to create your own, without the need for the paper.

## Features
* Responsive web app that allows the gmae to be played
* Instant game with the use of the words from database
* Create words for the game using multiuple devices
* Store the selected words after the game is over

## Tech
* SQL database
* Svelt for the web app
* Kotlin for the backend server

## Target
* Young people that know the game, but don't have time to set it up
* People who lack resources to set up the game
* People who want to keep track of the keywords they have played in the past
