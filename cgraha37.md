### About Me

Hello, I'm Christian! I decided to switch from computer engineering to computer science as I found programming to be more interesting than electrical engineering and I'm really happy with my decision. I am not sure if I will go into computer science as a career or if I'll go into an area such as web developement or UX design.

My Interests:
- House Plants
- Cartoons and Anime
 - [Here's](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/6lack_naruto) a list of the anime I've seen
- Music
 - All kinds, mostly rap and R&B
- Creating
- Being Active
- Thrifting
- Community Service

For the most part, I think my interests say a lot about what kind of person I am/want to be but they are constantly changing as I grow into myself.

I am at least _roughly_ familiar with the following programming languages:
- C++
- Python
- Javascript
- Will soon be familiar with C

_Thank you for reading!_
